```

## Prefix

All API URL is prefixed by `/api/v1`


## User Identity

`user_role` will always be returned in `extra` section

Every API call (except register/login) will need either a `token` or `guest_id` to access.
* If `token` was provided in request, `token_expire` is returned in `extra`
  - token expired : user is considered as **expired customer**, who need to log in again
  - token not expired : user is considered as **valid customer**
* If `guest_id` was provided in request, user is considered as **known guest**, nothing will be returned within `extra`
* If neither `token` nor `guest_id` was provided, user is considered as **unknown**, a new `guest_id` will be returned within `extra`
